          Automated build from main branch.
          
          **Installation:**
          1. Download and extract `KackyWatcher.zip`
          2. Run `KackyWatcher.exe`
          3. The app will prompt you to install Playwright browsers on first run (required, ~100-200MB download)
          4. Files (`settings.json`, `watchlist.txt`, `map_status.json`) will be created automatically on first run
